# Black Box Optimization on a Function with Known Properties

Source codes for my submitted project.

## Contains
1. a script to train and evaluate a model for approximating a function with known properties,
2. a script to find the maximum value of a function using only zero-order information,
3. a unit and regression test for utilities,
4. an integration test that assesses errors in tasks of the above scripts.

## Requirements
A requirements.txt is provided.
